Skyrocket enables you to build multi-threaded applications, helping you create apps
 that consistently function at 60fps even in the most advanced use cases in hostile environments.

## Installation

`ember install skyrocket-engine`


### Scaffold A Worker

```cli
ember g worker <worker-name>
```

Produces the following:
```cli
  /app/workers/<worker-name>/
     contract.js
     worker.js
```

When building or serving your ember application, `<worker-name>/worker.js` will be built as
as stand alone file located at `/assets/workers/<worker-name>.js`, while
`<worker-name>/contract.js` will be loaded into your app.

### Imports

Your worker can take full advantage of `es6` imports.

### Restrictions

Workers are workers, if a module does something that uses a browser API
that's not available in a worker, it will error. In the near future, 
you will be able to import environment stubs to provide your worker needed
 browser shims as well.
 

## Creating Your First Worker

### The Contract

The contract is a "model" of your Worker's exposed API.  It represents the
asynchronous methods, events, and properties (called snapshots) which will be available
to your app.

```js
import { Contract, Primitives:p } from 'skyrocket';

export default Interface.extend({
  foo: p.snapshot(),
  bar: p.method(),
  baz: p.event({ outbound: false }), // specify an inbound (to the main thread) only event
  spam: p.event({ inbound: false }) // specify an outbound (to the worked) only event
});
```

### The worker

The Worker is the stand alone mini-application that will be created when an Interface is instantiated.
It should implement the primitives that the Interface defines.

```js
import { Worker } from 'skyrocket';
import api from './interface';

export default Worker.extend({
  'interface': api,

  // foo is a property, but also a snapshot.
  // whenever foo updates, it's new state will
  // be updated on the app
  foo: 'hello world',

  // bar can be invoked from app
  // it's return can be a value or a promise
  bar() {
    this.send('baz', {}); // send the baz event to the app
  },
  onSpam: on('spam', function() {}) // do something when the worker receives the spam event
});
```


## Using Your Worker


## Fastboot

We'll make it work by 0.2.x
